      <h1>Germany Fieldwork</h1>
      <p class="header-description">
        In December 2024, two of our team members, Erika and Lanka, receieved
        funding through the Common Mission Project to visit the Joint
        Multinational Readiness Center in Hohenfels, Germany. The base was the
        source of the problem statement our team tackled during the Innovating
        for National Security program at UC San Diego.

        Our initial MVP revolved around using the Tactical Voice Bridge (TVB) to
        connect the legacy SINCGAR radios used by Observer Coach Trainer (OCT)
        Teams, and the modern Integrated Tactical Network (ITN) radios used by
        training forces. While our research into the device's capabilities
        indicated the connection should work, we needed to verify this before
        moving forward. Our Innovating for National Security (i4NS) Team
        Sponsor, Captain Christian Perez from the JMRC procured a TVB and both
        radio types, allowing our team members to physically verify that the
        device can connect the formerly incompatible equipment.

        Through numerous interviews with OCTs and other JMRC training staff,
        Erika and Lanka uncovered a key overarching challenge the base faced
        beyond incompatible equipment: the decentralization of training data.
        While there were existing systems in place to attempt to monitor
        geolocation and audio data during training sessions, they were largely
        ineffective and not consolidated in an accessible format. The staff
        unanimously agreed that the incompatibility of equipment coupled with a
        lack of access to data-driven insights severely hinders training
        effectiveness. Seeing how crucial overcoming this challenge would be,
        our team was even more assured that the data centralization dashboard
        MVP we designed would be invaluable.

        Erika and Lanka presented our monitoring dashboard prototypes to JMRC
        staff, collecting key critiques for further iteration. The feedback
        received was overwhelmingly positive, validating our proposed solution
        for providing OCTs with the ability to monitor all aspects of training
        sessions. OCTs emphasized the need for real-time audio transcripts,
        visualized geolocation data and event tagging to bring up relevant data
        during After Action Reviews. With this confirmation that our vision of a
        centralized hub of data streams is crucial to addressing their major
        pain points, we have moved forward with development.
